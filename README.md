devtools
========

A collection of useful dev tools to help avoid the need to type senstive data
into command line.

Also serves as a POC of having a central ViewModel supporting multiple different
types of front end.

Currently supported front ends: `cli`, `gtk4`, `iced` (iced is the most fully
featured currently).

To run:

```bash
cargo run --bin {cli,gtk4,iced}
```
